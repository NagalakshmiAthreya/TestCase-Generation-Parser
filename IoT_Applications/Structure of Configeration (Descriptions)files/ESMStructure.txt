2. Generic structure for ESM description:
An Event Source Mapping (ESM) is typically associated with serverless computing platforms like AWS Lambda, 
where it connects event sources (e.g., AWS services, S3 buckets, streams) to Lambda functions. 

The structure of an Event Source Mapping description would depend on the specific platform and service you are using, 
but here's a general structure you can use as a reference, particularly for AWS Lambda:
{
      "UUID": "mapping-uuid-1",
      "BatchSize": 10,
      "EventSourceArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:L6",
      "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:L1",
    .....
    "FilterCriteria": {
        "Filters": [
            {
                "AttributeName": "status",
                "AttributeValue": {"S": "completed"
                    }
                }]},
        // Other event source mappings
    }

"EventSourceArn"": The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the event source, such as an AWS service, S3 bucket, or stream.
"function_name": The name of the AWS Lambda function that will be triggered by events.
"Filter criteria" are specific conditions or rules used to narrow down
a dataset or set of results to include only those that meet certain requirements.
