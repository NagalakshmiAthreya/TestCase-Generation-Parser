An EventBridge Rule Description is used to define the conditions and actions associated with a rule in Amazon EventBridge 
(formerly known as Amazon CloudWatch Events). 
EventBridge allows you to route and process events from various sources to different targets based on specified rules. 

Here's a generalized structure for describing an EventBridge rule:

  {
        "Name": "DynamoDBToSNSRule",
        "EventPattern": {
            "source": [
                "aws.dynamodb"
            ],
            "detail-type": [
                "DynamoDB Table Activity"
            ],
            "detail": {
                "eventSource": [
                    "dynamodb.amazonaws.com"
                ],
                "eventName": [
                    "Insert",
                    "Modify",
                    "Remove"
                ],
                "requestParameters": {
                    "tableName": [
                        "YourDynamoDBTableName"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        "State": "ENABLED",
        "Description": "Rule that triggers an SNS topic for DynamoDB events",
        "Targets": [
            {
                "Id": "SnsTarget",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:YourSnsTopic"
            }
        ]
    },
In this example JSON structure:

"Name" is a user-defined name for the EventBridge rule.
"event_pattern" defines the conditions that trigger the rule. It specifies the sources, detail types, 
and specific details of events that should match the pattern.
"source" and "detailType" filter events based on their source and detail type.
"detail" allows you to filter events based on specific attributes within the event detail.
"state" indicates whether the rule is enabled or disabled.
"targets" specifies the actions to be taken when the rule is triggered. In this example, there are two targets:
The first target is an AWS Lambda function specified by its ARN, and it also includes an optional input field, 
which can pass additional data to the Lambda function.
The second target is an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue specified by its ARN, 
and it uses the inputPath to extract specific data from the event and send it to the queue.
