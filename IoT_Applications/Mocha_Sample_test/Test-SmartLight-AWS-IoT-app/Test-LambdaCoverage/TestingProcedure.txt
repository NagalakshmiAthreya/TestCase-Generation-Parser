Identify the Observable Behavior: 
Start by identifying the observable behavior or expected outcomes of lambda1(DeviceData_Lambda) based on the event information, that we have obtained with testcase from LambdaCoverage, 
like where the event(source(sensor data/HTTP))that triggered the Lambda. 
What does lambda1 do with the event? What are the expected side effects or responses?(by manual analysis of Lambda source code and logs)

Test Scenarios: Create test scenarios based on the observable behavior. 
These scenarios should cover different cases or conditions that lambda1 might encounter based on the event. 
For example, you can create test scenarios for different values of uv_visible if that's the primary input.

Mock Dependencies: 
If lambda1 interacts with external services or AWS services, you may need to mock those interactions using libraries like aws-sdk-mock or stubs/spies if the Lambda function uses other JavaScript modules. 
This allows you to control the behavior of external services during testing.

Invoke the Lambda Function: 
Invoke lambda1 with the test event for each scenario you've defined. 
Capture any outputs or responses that the Lambda function produces.

Assertions: Write assertions based on the expected behavior of lambda1. 
These assertions should check whether the Lambda function behaves as expected for each scenario. 
we may need to check the response, logs, or any other observable outputs.
